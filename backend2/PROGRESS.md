# Hotel Reservation System - Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Docker Environment Setup**
   - Verified Docker installation is working
   - Tested Docker Compose setup in both root and backend2 folders
   - Created and configured necessary Dockerfiles for all services
   - Set up docker-compose.yml with proper environment variables

2. **Database Setup**
   - Successfully connected to MySQL database
   - Initialized database schema with all required tables
   - Tested direct database access from Node.js

3. **API Testing**
   - Created a test API server to simulate microservices
   - Successfully tested authentication endpoints (register and login)
   - Verified that API can interact with the database

## Next Steps

1. **Service Implementation**
   - Implement proper NestJS controllers for all services
   - Set up service classes with business logic
   - Implement proper DTO validation

2. **Inter-service Communication**
   - Configure TCP-based communication between microservices
   - Set up message patterns for service-to-service requests

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Set up proper role-based authorization

4. **API Gateway**
   - Configure proper routing in the API gateway
   - Implement request validation at the gateway level

5. **Testing**
   - Create unit tests for services
   - Set up integration tests for API endpoints
   - Implement end-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Notes

- The Docker environment is set up and working
- The database schema is properly configured
- Basic endpoint testing confirms networking is working correctly
- The foundation is ready for implementing the actual microservices with NestJS

When you're ready to continue development, you can:
1. Start the database with `docker-compose up -d db phpmyadmin`
2. Use the test API server (`node test-endpoints.js`) to continue testing functionality
3. Begin implementing individual microservices based on the existing structure
